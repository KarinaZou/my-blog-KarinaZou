<h3>Self review</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>What did I do well?
My homework may seem mediocre and there will be many problems that need to improve. But in my opinion, I think the best thing is that I finished this homework. I just started my graduate course this semester, and I lacked a lot of basic knowledge. Before I did this assignment, I was confused and didnâ€™t know how to do it. I even emailed to teachers, hoping that I can get a extention. Now I am grateful that teacher rejected my request for extension. Because after the despair, I calmed down to study each step and start to reflect on your own learning methods.Finally I did my best to complete the homework as required. I was not beaten by the fear at the time. When I finished the homework, I felt a great sense of accomplishment.I believe I will meet more difficulties in my future studies, but I will try my best to overcome it.</p></li>
<li><p>The points I need to inprove.I think my biggest problem is that my table does not play a important role in analyzing data.My table neither to analyze the changing trend of the data, nor to compare with the data of other countries.</p></li>
