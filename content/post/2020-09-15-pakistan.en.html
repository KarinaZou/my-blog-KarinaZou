<h2>Steady decline in Pakistan’s caseload</h2>
<p>People from all over the world have been fighting with Covid-19 for several months. A look at the present global Covid-19 trajectory shows that a handful of countries that had reported some of the worst outbreaks in June and July have started witnessing a persistent and steady decline in caseload.Pakistan witnessed a sudden spike in infections and deaths in June, but confirmed cases have gradually declined since then.</p>
<p>We can see the daily new cases and daily death in Pakistan from the plot below,The virus started picking up pace in Pakistan in May, with the country reporting between 989 (May 2) and 3,039 (May 30) cases on a daily basis. The peak hit on June 13 when as many as 6,825 cases were reported in a single day. Since the middle of June, the number of new cases has declined steadily, with the figure falling below 1,000 in August and below 600 in September.(CGTN, 2020).<a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-09-16/Pakistan-s-fight-against-COVID-19-A-success-story--TPi9CHkXbq/index.html">CGTN</a></p>
<p>Recently Pakistan has seen the number of weekly infections steadily decreasing. The reason behind arresting the rise in Covid-19 cases lies in the country’s increased testing capacity in a very short period and setting up a sophisticated tracking system, which included over 10,000 contract workers and more than 3,000 contact tracing teams on the ground. Besides, strict lockdowns in hotspots and hefty fines for violations also played a role.(theindianexpress, 2020).</p>
